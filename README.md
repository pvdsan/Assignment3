## Question 1 Refer Q1_SSD_Calculation.ipynb 
We will first select a random frame from output.avi
Then crop a roi and save it as roi.jpg.
This will then be matched again 10 frames selected at random from the video along with the SSD score.

## Question 2 Refer Q2_A_Part.pdf and Q2_A_Part2.pdf for the Handwritten work

## Q4 Finding Optical Flow Vectors Refer Q4_MATlab_OpticalFlow.mlx
Run the MATLAB Script to get 3 videos as output one after the other for i) Previosu frame as reference ii) Every 11th frame as reference  iii) Every 31st frame as refernce.
Here Are the snapshots in the same order

Further away the reference frame, less robust is our optical flow vectors
